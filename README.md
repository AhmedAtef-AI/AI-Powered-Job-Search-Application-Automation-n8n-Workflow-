## 🧩 Architecture Overview

### 1. **Telegram Entry Point**
- **Node:** `Telegram Trigger`
- Captures user messages from Telegram and forwards them to the AI Agent.

### 2. **AI-Powered Intent Understanding**
- **Node:** `Job Searching Agent`
- A LangChain agent powered by OpenRouter (LLM) and connected to memory.
- Parses user intent → generates structured JSON → triggers job search or CV actions.

### 3. **Job Retrieval (Indeed API)**
- **Node:** `Indeed Job Search Tool`
- Calls Apify’s `misceres~indeed-scraper` API with dynamic parameters (role, location, country, etc.).
- Returns structured job data.

### 4. **Job Logging & Retrieval**
- **Nodes:**  
  - `Jobs_Sheet` → Appends job data into a Google Sheet.  
  - `Search Jobs Sheet` → Searches previously logged jobs.  

### 5. **External Job Application**
- **Nodes:**  
  - `External Link Jobs Apply Tool`  
  - `Website Content Tool1`  
  - `Website Automation Tool1`
- Executes **headless browser automation** with Browserless:
  - Navigates to job application pages  
  - Detects form fields  
  - Fills applicant data (name, email, resume)  
  - Submits or simulates submission  
  - Returns a success status and screenshot

### 6. **CV Handling Workflow**
- **Nodes:**  
  - `On form submission` → Triggers when a CV is uploaded  
  - `Download file` → Retrieves CV from Google Drive  
  - `Extract from File` → Extracts text from the PDF  
  - `Embeddings OpenAI` → Converts text into vector embeddings  
  - `Pinecone Vector Store` → Stores embeddings in Pinecone  
- Enables **semantic CV search** and **job-to-profile matching**.

### 7. **CV Logs Management**
- **Nodes:**  
  - `Log CV` → Appends candidate data to “CV Logs” sheet  
  - `Get CV Logs` → Fetches existing records  
  - `CV Logs Delete` → Deletes outdated entries  

### 8. **AI Vector Retrieval**
- **Node:** `C.V DataBase`
- Retrieves vector data for candidate profiles or job similarity scoring.

### 9. **Message Response**
- **Node:** `Send a text message`
- Returns structured results, job lists, or confirmation messages to Telegram.

## 🧱 Data Flow Summary

1. User sends a command to Telegram (e.g., “Find backend developer jobs in Egypt”).  
2. The **AI agent** parses the message → extracts job title, country, location.  
3. Agent sends structured JSON to **Indeed API** via Apify.  
4. Job data is returned → saved to **Google Sheets**.  
5. A summarized message is sent back to the user via Telegram.  
6. If the user uploads a CV:  
   - The file is parsed → embedded via OpenAI → stored in Pinecone → logged in Google Sheets.  
7. When applying to jobs, the **Browserless tool** automates the submission safely.
